# Windows Inventory Agent Security Configuration

# Security Policies and Hardening Guidelines

## 1. Authentication and Authorization

### API Authentication
- Use JWT tokens with RS256 signing algorithm
- Token expiration: 1 hour for access tokens, 24 hours for refresh tokens
- Implement rate limiting: 100 requests per minute per IP
- Require HTTPS for all API communications

### Agent Authentication
- Use certificate-based authentication for agent-to-API communication
- Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure agent registration
- Rotate certificates every 90 days automatically

## 2. Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest
- Encrypt sensitive configuration files using Windows DPAPI
- Use AES-256 encryption for stored telemetry data
- Implement database-level encryption for SQL Server deployments

### Encryption in Transit
- Enforce TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Disable older TLS versions (1.0, 1.1)
- Use strong cipher suites only

### Data Sanitization
- Validate all input data against JSON schemas
- Implement output encoding to prevent injection attacks
- Sanitize file paths and command arguments

## 3. Access Control

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```yaml
roles:
  - name: admin
    permissions:
      - read:*
      - write:*
      - delete:*

  - name: operator
    permissions:
      - read:telemetry
      - read:policies
      - write:commands
      - read:devices

  - name: viewer
    permissions:
      - read:telemetry
      - read:devices
```

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Run agent service as Local Service account
- Use separate service accounts for different components
- Implement network segmentation

## 4. Security Monitoring

### Audit Logging
- Log all authentication attempts
- Record policy changes with user context
- Audit command executions
- Monitor data access patterns

### Security Events
- Alert on failed authentication attempts (>5 per minute)
- Monitor for suspicious command patterns
- Track certificate expiration dates
- Alert on schema validation failures

## 5. Compliance

### Data Retention
- Telemetry data: 90 days rolling retention
- Audit logs: 1 year retention
- Command history: 30 days retention

### Privacy Controls
- Implement data anonymization for sensitive information
- Support data export/deletion requests
- Comply with GDPR data protection requirements

## 6. Incident Response

### Security Incident Process
1. Detection: Automated monitoring alerts
2. Assessment: Security team evaluation
3. Containment: Isolate affected systems
4. Recovery: Restore from clean backups
5. Lessons Learned: Update security policies

### Emergency Contacts
- Security Team: security@company.com
- Incident Response: incident@company.com
- Legal/Compliance: legal@company.com

## 7. Security Testing

### Automated Security Tests
- Run OWASP ZAP scans weekly
- Perform dependency vulnerability scans
- Execute penetration testing quarterly
- Review code for security issues in CI/CD

### Manual Security Reviews
- Annual security architecture review
- Code security reviews for major changes
- Third-party dependency assessments

## 8. Security Configuration Files

### API Security Configuration
```yaml
security:
  jwt:
    issuer: "windows-inventory-agent"
    audience: "api"
    secret_rotation_days: 30

  tls:
    min_version: "1.3"
    cipher_suites:
      - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
      - TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256

  rate_limiting:
    requests_per_minute: 100
    burst_limit: 200
```

### Agent Security Configuration
```yaml
security:
  certificate:
    ca_cert_path: "/etc/ssl/certs/ca.pem"
    cert_path: "/etc/ssl/certs/agent.pem"
    key_path: "/etc/ssl/private/agent.key"
    rotation_days: 90

  data_encryption:
    enabled: true
    algorithm: "AES-256-GCM"

  secure_communication:
    server_cert_verification: true
    hostname_verification: true
```
