- [ ] Run database migrations

### 4. Application Configuration
- [ ] Update configuration files for production environment
- [ ] Configure external service integrations
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting endpoints
- [ ] Configure log aggregation and retention
- [ ] Set up health check endpoints

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Code Deployment
- [ ] Build production binaries with optimizations
- [ ] Create deployment packages (Docker images, MSI installers)
- [ ] Upload artifacts to artifact repository
- [ ] Update deployment manifests with new versions

### 2. Database Migration
- [ ] Backup production database
- [ ] Run database migrations in staging environment
- [ ] Validate migration scripts and rollback procedures
- [ ] Execute migrations in production with monitoring

### 3. Service Deployment
- [ ] Deploy API service with blue-green strategy
- [ ] Deploy agent service to target devices
- [ ] Update load balancer configurations
- [ ] Verify service health and connectivity

### 4. Configuration Updates
- [ ] Update DNS records if needed
- [ ] Rotate secrets and certificates
- [ ] Update monitoring configurations
- [ ] Configure backup schedules

## Post-Deployment Validation

### 1. Functional Testing
- [ ] Verify API endpoints are responding
- [ ] Test agent registration and telemetry submission
- [ ] Validate policy application and command execution
- [ ] Check web console functionality

### 2. Performance Validation
- [ ] Run automated load tests
- [ ] Monitor system resource usage
- [ ] Validate response times and error rates
- [ ] Check database performance metrics

### 3. Security Validation
- [ ] Verify TLS certificate configuration
- [ ] Test authentication and authorization
- [ ] Check audit logging functionality
- [ ] Validate security headers and configurations

### 4. Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Configure application monitoring
- [ ] Set up alerting rules and notifications
- [ ] Enable log aggregation and analysis
- [ ] Configure performance dashboards

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback
1. **Immediate rollback trigger**: High error rates (>20%) or critical functionality broken
2. **Steps**:
   - Stop load balancer traffic to new deployment
   - Scale down new deployment to zero
   - Scale up previous deployment
   - Update load balancer to route to previous version
   - Monitor system recovery

### Gradual Rollback
1. **Trigger**: Performance degradation or increased error rates
2. **Steps**:
   - Reduce traffic to new deployment (50%, then 25%, then 0%)
   - Monitor metrics during traffic reduction
   - Complete rollback if issues persist
   - Analyze root cause before re-deployment

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Daily Checks
- [ ] Review error rates and performance metrics
- [ ] Check system resource utilization
- [ ] Verify backup completion
- [ ] Monitor security alerts

### Weekly Maintenance
- [ ] Review and rotate logs
- [ ] Update security patches
- [ ] Optimize database performance
- [ ] Review monitoring alerts and thresholds

### Monthly Activities
- [ ] Run comprehensive load tests
- [ ] Review and update security policies
- [ ] Analyze performance trends
- [ ] Plan capacity upgrades if needed

## Incident Response

### Severity Levels
- **Critical**: System down, data loss, security breach
- **High**: Major functionality broken, performance severely degraded
- **Medium**: Partial functionality issues, elevated error rates
- **Low**: Minor issues, cosmetic problems

### Response Times
- **Critical**: Response within 15 minutes, resolution within 1 hour
- **High**: Response within 30 minutes, resolution within 4 hours
- **Medium**: Response within 2 hours, resolution within 24 hours
- **Low**: Response within 24 hours, resolution within 1 week

### Communication Plan
- **Internal**: Slack channels for real-time updates
- **External**: Status page updates for customers
- **Escalation**: On-call rotation with backup contacts

## Success Criteria
